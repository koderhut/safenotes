# How to contribute

I am glad you enjoy my little project and even more glad that you would like to contribute.

If you would like to contribute with code please check the Submitting changes section below.

To submit a bug report or feature request please use the Github Issues.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to koderhut/safenotes](https://github.com/koderhut/safenotes/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
When you send a pull request, please include a minimal amount of tests for your feature. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
