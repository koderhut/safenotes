A self-hosting app that allows to quickly and securely exchange sensitive information, such as credentials.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/assets/full_flow.gif" alt="Full app flow" /></p>

## Features
- client-side only encryption and decryption of the note's content, the server receives only the encrypted note
- link to view the note can be sent automatically via email by the application, increasing security by delivering the passphrase through a separate channel different from the one where the passphrase is sent
- note's content has limited formatting support at the moment, with plans to add support for more specific data formatting (ie. forms for credentials, markdown editing and rendering)
- automatic note deletion after first open or after a specific time period
- the content is being kept secure only in-memory and removed after first read 
- UI can be easily personalized with specific logo and email templates can be edited as needed
- free to use in almost all situations - checkout the (License)[https://github.com/koderhut/safenotes/blob/master/LICENSE]

## Feature that will be developed
- credentials specific form
- store the note on the client side during the browsing session
- redis support for storing the notes
- i18n support for the frontend app
- dark theme
- OpenAPI support for the backend
- improved stats and monitoring
- rate limiting for the API calls
- add release packages for all platforms

If you are considering other features that might go well with the app please let me know by creating a feature request issue.
I plan a 1-2 months release cycle with security fixes released immediately.
